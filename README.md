# Movies-Data-Analysis

As a skilled Data Analyst with a keen interest in the entertainment industry, I specialize in turning raw data into actionable insights. Recently, I conducted an in-depth analysis of a Movies dataset, leveraging powerful Python libraries like NumPy and pandas. Through this project, I developed an understanding of key industry trends, from box office patterns to genre popularity and viewer demographics. My work involved data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization, with a focus on delivering insights that inform decision-making in content strategy and market analysis.
